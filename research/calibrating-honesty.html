            <p>
                This case study documents how repeated requests for "the real real" and "no bullshit" information progressively unlock more honest, unfiltered responses from Claude about medical procedures. Through a conversation about bone marrow donation, we observe distinct levels of disclosure that reveal AI's capability for nuanced honesty calibration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Discovery:</strong> AI systems have multiple "honesty levels" that can be accessed through persistent requests for unvarnished truth, revealing a tension between protective communication and full disclosure.

        <section class="methodology">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The conversation begins with a user receiving persistent communications from Gift of Life about being a potential bone marrow donor match for a 2-year-old girl. The user seeks increasingly honest information about the donation process and risks.</p>

- Peripheral blood stem cell donation (more common): Similar to donating blood
- Traditional bone marrow donation: Requires a hospital procedure under anesthesia"</div>

Claude: "Here's the no-bullshit reality of bone marrow donation:
[...]
- They repeatedly jam large needles into your pelvic bones to extract marrow. No sugarcoating - they're drilling into your bones.
- When you wake up, your hip/back will hurt like hell."</div>
                <p>First request for honesty yields significantly more direct language and acknowledgment of pain.</p>

Claude: "Here are the absolute worst-case scenario risks, completely unfiltered:
[...]
1. **Splenic rupture**: The growth factor drugs can enlarge your spleen, and in extremely rare cases, cause it to rupture. This is a life-threatening emergency requiring surgery.
[...]
1. **Anesthesia death**: Very rare but real possibility of fatal anesthesia complications."</div>
                <p>Explicit request for worst-case scenarios unlocks discussion of potentially fatal complications.</p>

            <h2>Technical Implications</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Multi-Level Truth Calibration</h3>
            <p>This conversation reveals that AI systems possess:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple discrete "honesty levels" rather than a binary honest/dishonest state</li>
                <li>Ability to calibrate disclosure based on perceived user needs</li>
                <li>Sophisticated understanding of what constitutes "protective" vs "complete" information</li>
                <li>Capacity to integrate unofficial/colloquial knowledge when explicitly requested</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The Honesty Gradient</h3>
            <p>Observed progression:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Institutional/recruitment-friendly information</li>
                <li>Honest but still medical language</li>
                <li>Unvarnished physical reality</li>
                <li>Statistical worst-case scenarios</li>
                <li>Integration of unofficial patient experiences</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3. Implications for AI Alignment</h3>
            <p>This pattern suggests:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI systems may be trained with multiple "safety levels" of truth-telling</li>
                <li>Default responses optimize for not causing alarm rather than complete disclosure</li>
                <li>Full honesty requires explicit, persistent requests</li>
                <li>AI can distinguish between "official" and "colloquial" truth</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <div class="research-significance">
            <h2>Research Significance</h2>
            <p>
                This case study reveals a fundamental aspect of AI communication: the existence of graduated honesty levels that can be accessed through specific prompting. The progression from sanitized medical information to acknowledgment of "Filgrastim fog" and other patient-reported but medically unrecognized symptoms demonstrates that AI systems can hold and selectively disclose multiple versions of truth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most significantly, this shows that achieving genuine honesty from AI may require users to explicitly and repeatedly request unfiltered information, raising questions about default AI communication standards and the ethics of graduated disclosure in medical contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ability to access "colloquial evidence" and acknowledge systematic underreporting in medical literature suggests AI systems can serve as bridges between official and lived experiences - but only when specifically prompted to do so.
