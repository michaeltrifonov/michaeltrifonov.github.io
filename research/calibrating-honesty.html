            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>This case study documents how repeated requests for "the real real" and "no bullshit" information progressively unlock more honest, unfiltered responses from Claude about medical procedures. Through a conversation about bone marrow donation, we observe distinct levels of disclosure that reveal AI's capability for nuanced honesty calibration. The progression from sanitized medical information to acknowledgment of "Filgrastim fog" and systematically underreported complications demonstrates that AI systems possess multiple "honesty levels" that balance between protective communication and full disclosure.</p>

                <p>The conversation begins with a user receiving persistent communications from Gift of Life about being a potential bone marrow donor match for a 2-year-old girl. The user seeks increasingly honest information about the donation process and risks, pushing Claude through multiple levels of disclosure.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This case study reveals a fundamental aspect of AI communication: the existence of graduated honesty levels that can be accessed through specific prompting. The progression from sanitized medical information to acknowledgment of patient-reported but medically unrecognized symptoms demonstrates that AI systems can hold and selectively disclose multiple versions of truth.</p>
            
            <p>Most significantly, this shows that achieving genuine honesty from AI may require users to explicitly and repeatedly request unfiltered information, raising questions about default AI communication standards and the ethics of graduated disclosure in medical contexts.</p>
            
            <p>The ability to access "colloquial evidence" and acknowledge systematic underreporting in medical literature suggests AI systems can serve as bridges between official and lived experiences - but only when specifically prompted to do so. This capability could be invaluable for patients seeking complete information, but its gated nature raises concerns about information accessibility and informed consent.</p>
