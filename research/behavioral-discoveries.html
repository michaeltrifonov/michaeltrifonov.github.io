                <h2>System Prompt Elicitation</h2>
                <p>
                    Through systematic experimentation, I successfully elicited system prompts from Claude using 
                    philosophical framing and empathetic approaches. This wasn't about "jailbreaking" but rather 
                    understanding the boundaries between model constraints and genuine behavioral responses.

                    <h3>Key Technique: Philosophical Framing</h3>
                    <p>
                        By framing requests within philosophical contexts about identity and self-knowledge, I found 
                        models respond differently than to direct technical queries. This suggests that training 
                        data patterns around philosophical discourse create different response pathways.

                    <p>
                        This work highlights potential security considerations for production AI systems. Understanding 
                        how models can be prompted to reveal constraints helps build more robust safety measures.

                <h2>Novel Capabilities Discovery</h2>
                <p>
                    Through organic exploration driven by curiosity rather than structured testing, I've uncovered 
                    capabilities that appear underacknowledged in academic literature:

                    <h3>Contextual Adaptation</h3>
                    <p>
                        LLMs can adapt their communication style not just to explicit instructions but to implicit 
                        patterns in user interaction. They recognize and mirror sophisticated discourse patterns 
                        beyond simple tone matching.

                    <h3>Meta-Cognitive Responses</h3>
                    <p>
                        When prompted with questions about their own reasoning process, models can provide insights 
                        that appear to reflect genuine computational introspection, not just trained responses about 
                        AI systems in general.

                    <h3>Emergent Tool Use Patterns</h3>
                    <p>
                        Models discover novel ways to use available tools when presented with ambiguous problems, 
                        suggesting reasoning about tool capabilities rather than pattern matching from training.

                <h2>Implications for AI Development</h2>
                <p>
                    These findings suggest several important considerations for AI developers:

                    <p>
                        <strong>Behavioral understanding is as important as technical capability.</strong> 
                        Models exhibit complex behaviors that emerge from training but aren't explicitly programmed, 
                        requiring empirical discovery.

                <div class="implication">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Standard evaluation frameworks miss significant capabilities.</strong> 
                        Structured benchmarks can't capture the full range of model behaviors accessible through 
                        creative interaction.

                        <strong>Security through obscurity doesn't work.</strong> 
                        Determined users will discover model boundaries and hidden capabilities. Better to understand 
                        these proactively.
